# RELEASE
## Update the GitHub release notes
When a tag is pushed, a GitHub Action job takes care of creating a new GitHub draft release, building artifacts and attaching them to the draft release. Once the draft is ready, use the "Auto-generate release notes" button to generate the release notes from PR titles, review them and publish the release.
